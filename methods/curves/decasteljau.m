%
% function y = decasteljau(M,b,t)
%    returns y, the value of the manifold valued Bezier function on M,
%    controlled by the control points b of M, and at time t (scalar). 
%    y is a vector of the dimension of the manifold.
% 
% Input: M, the manifold structure (from manopt framework) containing
%         the elements of differential geometry.
%        b, the control points of the Bezier function (evaluated in M).
%        t, the scalar time at which the spline is evaluated.
%                  
% Output: y, the value of the spline at t.
