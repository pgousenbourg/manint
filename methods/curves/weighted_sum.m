function x = weighted_sum(w,y,M,u)
% Computes a weighted sum.
% 
% function x = weighted_sum(w,y)
% Computes the weighted sum x = sum_i ( w_i*y_i ). More specifically, it
% solves the problem
%      x = argmin_z sum_i ( w_i * dist(z,y_i) )
%
% Input: w, a vector of weights;
%        y, the data points in a m-by-n-by-p, where [m,n] is the
%           the dimension of the space and p is the number of points.
%           length(w) must be the same size as p.
%        M, the manifold structure containing differential geometry.
% 		 u, the reference point as m-by-n matrix. If not given, it will
% 			be the first point.
%
% Output: x, the summary vector of size [m,n].
