% function y = decasteljau_eucl(b,t)
%    returns y, the value of the Euclidean Bezier function,
%    controlled by the control points b, and at time t (scalar). 
%    y is a vector of the dimension of the space of b.
% 
% Input: b, the control points of the Bezier function.
%        t, the scalar time at which the spline is evaluated.
%                  
% Output: y, the value of the spline at t.
