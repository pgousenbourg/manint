% function cp = cp_constraints(x,Ncp)
%    Returns the control points cp by applying the constraints of the
%    Bezier problem to x.
% 
% Input: x - the solution of the optimization
%        Ncp - the number of control points
% 		 M - the manifold
%                   
% Output: cp, the control points, stored in a [m,n,p] matrix where
%         [m,n] is the size of an element of the manifold problem.M.name
%         and p is the index of the control point of the Bezier curve.
