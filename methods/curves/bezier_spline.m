function y = bezier_spline(problem,t,display)
% Returns the value of the Bezier spline controlled by control points cp
% at time t.
%
% function y = bezier_spline(problem,t,method)
%    returns y, a matrix of size [m,n,p] containing the value of the
%    hybrid Bezier spline B at times t. B is composed of second order 
%    Bezier functions as first and last segments, and cubic Bezier 
%    functions as intermediate segments. t may be a vector of values
%    with 0 <= t <= (size(cp) + 2)/3
% 
% Input: problem, the structure of the problem with 
% 			control : control points on M
% 			Tcp 	: control points on the tangent spaces of di
% 			data 	: the data points
% 		 t, the time at which the curve is evaluated
% 		 display, if a waitbar must be displayed
%                  
% Output: y, the value of the spline at t, stored in a [m x n x p].
