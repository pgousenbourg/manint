function [v, varargout] = curveVelocity(varargin);
% CURVEVELOCITY returns the value V of the velocity of the manifold-
%    valued curve GAMMA at a given time T. The velocity is given as a 
%    tangent vector at GAMMA(T). The velocity is computed as a forward
%    finite difference of the curve. The velocity at the last point of
%    GAMMA is the reverted finite difference between the last and 
%    before-last points.
%
%    V = CURVEVELOCITY(M,GAMMA,T) returns V, the value of the 
%    velocity of GAMMA at time T, on a manifold M. T are the values of
%    the parameter at which GAMMA is evaluated.
%
%    [V,TSPAN] = CURVEVELOCITY(M,DATAPOINTS,T) returns also the time 
%    needed to compute each value of the velocity.
%
%    Inputs: 
%      M is a manifold structure from Manopt - www.manopt.org.
%      GAMMA must be a matrix [n_rows,n_cols,n], where (n_rows,n_cols) 
%        is the dimension of the search space, and n is the number of 
%        points in GAMMA.
%      T is a vector of length n, containing the coordinate at which 
%        each value of GAMMA is evaluated.
%
%    Outputs:
%      V is a matrix of size [n_rows,n_cols,p] containing the values of 
%        the velocity of the curve GAMMA, at T. Note that V(:,:,i)
%        belongs to the Tangent Space of M at GAMMA(:,:,i).
%      TSPAN (optional) is a vector that contains the time spent to compute
%        the fitting curve at times contained in T.
