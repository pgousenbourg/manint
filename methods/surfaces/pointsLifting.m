function tangentValues = pointsLifting(M,rootPoints,points)
% Lifts the points in the tangent space of the last element of rootPoints 
% by transporting the points through all elements of rootPoints.
%
% function tangentValues = pointsLifting(M,rootPoints,points)
%    returns tangentValues, the representation in T_{rootPoints{end}}M 
%    of the points, lifted thanks to the M.log operator of M, a manifold
%    manopt-structure, and transported through M.transp.
%    The points are first lifted in the first element of rootPoints,
%    and then the tangent values are transported from element to element
%    of rootPoints, and the distance between each rootPoint is
%    accumulated at each transport.
%
% inputs:  M, a manopt manifold-structure containing the M.log operator.
%          rootPoints, a m-cell of point on the manifold M.
%          points, [DIM]-cell of points to be lifted to the tangent 
%            space at rootPoint.
%
% outputs: tangentValues, a [DIM]-cell containing the lifted version
%            the points to the tangent spaces at root.
