function domain = makeDomain(rootCoords)
% creates the matrix of the regular grid, where each line refers to
% the four indexes of the rootCoords vector of the four corners of the
% domain.
%
% function DOMAIN = makeDomain(ROOTCOORDS)
%    returns DOMAIN, the matrix of domains based on ROOTCOORDS.
%
% Inputs:  ROOTCOORDS must encapsulate the coordinates of a regular 
%          grid, given in a [(m*n)x2] matrix. Each line is a (X,Y)-
%          coordinate. Order has no importance; m and n correspond to
%          the number of X- and Y- coordinates in the regular grid.
%
% Outputs: DOMAIN is a [(m-1)*(n-1) x 5] matrix of the following form:
%          DOMAIN(:,1) is the parent column. It is set to zeros in this
%            initialization step. Parenting can is used when the grid is
%            refined (see also: refineGrid).
%          DOMAIN(:,2:5) contains the four indexes of the rootCoords
%            of the four corners of the domain.
%
% Corners of the domains are numbered in the following order 
% (grid-points are number as xy couples, hereunder). The same apprach is
% used for screening the domains.
%
%         01  ---  11       ->     w{3}  ---  w{4}
%          |       |                |          |
%          |       |                |          |
%         00  ---  10              w{1}  ---  w{2}
