function tangentValues = basicLifting(M,rootPoints,dataPoints)
% Lifts the dataPoints in the tangent space of each rootPoint.
%
% function tangentValues = basicLifting(M,rootPoints,dataPoints)
%    returns tangentValues, the representation in T_{rootPoints{i}}M of
%    the dataPoints, lifted thanks to the M.log operator of M, a manifold
%    manopt-structure.
%
% inputs:  M, a manopt manifold-structure containing the M.log operator.
%          rootPoints, a vector-cell of P elements with the rootPoint on 
%            the manifold M.
%          dataPoints, a vector-cell of Q points to be lifted to the 
%            tangent space at rootPoints.
%
% outputs: tangentValues, a [PxQ]-cell containing the lifted
%            version of the points to the tangent spaces at rootPoints.
