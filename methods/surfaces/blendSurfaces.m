function y = blendSurfaces(M,rootPoints,tangentValues,weights,average)
% Blends four tangentValues together. 
%
% function Y = blendSurfaces(M,rootPoints,tangentValues,weights)
%    returns Y, the blended version of the four given tangentValues (in
%    the tangent space T_rootPoints(M)) and with respect to given
%    weights.
%
% function Y = blendSurfaces(M,rootPoints,tangentValues,weights,average)
%    returns Y, the blended version of the tangentValues, with a chosen
%    averaging method, furnished as a handle function.
%    By default, the averaging is done by average = @tensorMean.
%
% inputs:  M, a manopt manifold-structure.
%          rootPoints, a 4-cell containing the rootPoints at which
%            the tangentValues are evaluated.
%          tangentValues, a 4-cell containing the four tangent
%            surfaces in the tangent spaces of the rootPoints.
%            The tangent surfaces in each entries of the cell are stored
%            in a [DIMxmxn] matrix, where [m,n] is the dimention of M.
%          weights, a 4-cell matrix containing the weights used to
%            blend the tangentValues once mapped back to the manifold.
%            The entries of the cell are [DIM]-matrices.
%            If weights is a 4-vector, then the same 4 
%            weights will be used for every tangentValues.
%          average (optional), a handleFunction that averages four
%            points with given weights. Default: tensorMean.
%            The function must be defined as
%            
%            f = @(M,points,weights) average(M,points,weights).
%
% outputs: Y, a matrix [DIMxmxn] with all the blended values in M.
