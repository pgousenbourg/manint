% function tps = thinPlateSplineReconstruction(X,Y,repr,t)
%    returns tps, the value of the Euclidean Thin Plate Spline driven 
%    by the coefficients repr.a and repd.d, evaluated at (X,Y), on the 
%    time set t.
%
% inputs:  X,Y are time parameters contained in a [p,q] matrix;
%          repr. is a structure containing 
%            - repr.d has [ndp,m,n] entries (where ndp was previously the
%              number of data points to fit);
%            - repr.a has [3,m,n] entries.
%          t is the time set (this is a [ndp,2] matrix)
%
% outputs: tps is a [p,q,m,n] matrix.
