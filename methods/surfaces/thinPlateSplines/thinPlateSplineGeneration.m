function repr = thinPlateSplineGeneration(dataPoints,dataCoords,lambda)
% Returns the coefficients conducting the Euclidean thin Plate Spline.
%
% function repr = thinPlateSplineGeneration(dataPoints,dataCoords)
%    returns repr, a structure containing repr.a and repr.d,
%    the coefficients driving the Thin Plate Spline
%    interpolating the dataPoints{i} at dataCoords(i).
%
% function repr = thinPlateSplineGeneration(dataPoints,dataCoords,lambda)
%    returns repr, a structure containing repr.a and repr. d, 
%    the coefficients driving the Thin Plate Spline
%    fitting the dataPoints{i} at dataCoords(i) with a fitting parameter
%    lambda (the smaller, the closer).
%
% inputs:  dataPoints is a n-dimensional cell. Stores the data points
%            of size [p,q].
%          dataCoords is a [nx2]-matrix. Stores the coordinates at which
%            the data points must be fitted.
%          lambda     is a scalar (optional). The smaller, the closer to
%            interpolation the curve will be.
%
% outputs: repr. d is a [n,p,q]-dimensional matrix, collecting the values of 
%            the coefficients associated to the rbf.
%          repr. a is a [3,p,q]-dimensional matrix, with the coefficients 
%            associated to the affine part of the TPS.
