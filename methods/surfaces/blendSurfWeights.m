function w = blendSurfWeights(X,Y,rootCoords)
% Blending weights used in the blending technique of surfaces.
%
% function w = blendSurfWeights(X,Y)
%    returns w, a 4-cell containing the four weights used in the
%    blending of surfaces at times (X,Y) in [0,1]x[0,1]. By default, the
%    positions of the linearization points are supposed to be at the 
%    corners of this unitary patch.
%    Each weights entry is a matrix of the same size as x and y.
%    The weights are stored in the following (graphical) manner:
%        
%         01  ---  11       ->     w{3}  ---  w{4}
%          |       |                |          |
%          |       |                |          |
%         00  ---  10              w{1}  ---  w{2}
%
% function w = blendSurfWeights(X,Y,rootCoords)
%    returns w, a 4-cell containing the four weights used in the
%    blending of surfaces at time (X,Y) in the patch defined by the 
%    rootCoords.
%    When rootCoords is not specified, it falls down naturally to
%    the unitary patch [0,1]x[0,1].
%
% If X,Y are vectors with only one entry, then w is returned as a
% 4-vector.
%
% EXAMPLE: 
%    >> X = 0; Y = 0;
%    >> rootCoords = [0 0; 1 0; 0 1; 1 1];
%    >> blendSurfWeights(X,Y,rootCoords);
%    
%      ans = 
%         
%          1  0  0  0
%
% EXAMPLE 2:
%    >> X = [0 0 1 1];
%    >> Y = [0 1 0 1];
%    >> blendSurfWeights(X,Y)
%    
%      returns a 4-cell of [1x4]-matrices.
%
%
% inputs:  X,Y are coordinates of the same size ([pxq]-matrix);
%          rootCoords is a [4x2]-matrix of coordinates of the four 
%            corners of the patch.
%
% outputs: w is a [4]-cell of weights, where each entry is a 
%          [pxq]-matrix, except if p=q=1 (in that case, w is a
%          4-vector.

%   Jan. 06, 2020 (PYG) - Modification of the logic to stage better the
%                         with the rest of the project. Now weights are
