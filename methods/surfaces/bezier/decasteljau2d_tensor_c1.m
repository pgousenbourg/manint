function y = decasteljau2d_tensor_c1(varargin)
% Computes a Bezier curve by double tensorization.
%
% function y = decasteljau2d_tensor_c1(M,b,t1,t2,patchX,patchY,maxPatchX,maxPatchY)
%   returns y, the value of the Riemannian Bezier curve on the manifold
%   M at t1 and t2. The curve is driven by the points b (cell).
%   This method is for C1-patching of Bezier surfaces only. It requires
%     patchX - the number of the current patch (in X)
%     patchY - the number of the current patch (in Y)
%     maxPatchX - the max number of patches in the surface (in X)
%     maxPatchY - the max number of patches in the surface (in Y)
%
% function y = decasteljau2d_tensor_c1(M,b,t1,t2,patchX,patchY,maxPatchX,maxPatchY,'direction',DIRECTION)
%   returns y, the value of the Riemannian Bezier curve on the manifold
%   M by applying first the tensorization in the direction DIRECTION.
