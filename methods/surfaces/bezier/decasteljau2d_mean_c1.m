function y = decasteljau2d_mean_c1(varargin)
% Computes a Bezier curve with a 2d-karcher-mean approach such that
% the Bezier surface is C1
%
% function y = decasteljau2d_mean_c1(M,b,t1,t2,patchX,patchY,maxPatchX,maxPatchY)
%   returns y, the value of the Riemannian Bezier curve on the manifold
%   M at t1 and t2. The curve is driven by the points b (cell).
%   This method is for C1-patching of Bezier surfaces only. It requires
%     patchX - the number of the current patch (in X)
%     patchY - the number of the current patch (in Y)
%     maxPatchX - the max number of patches in the surface (in X)
%     maxPatchY - the max number of patches in the surface (in Y)
