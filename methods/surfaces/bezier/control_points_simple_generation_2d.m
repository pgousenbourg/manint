function pb = control_points_simple_generation_2d(pb)
% Returns the control points of an interpolating Bezier surface to
% a set of data points pb.dataPoints(i,j) at integer times 
% (t1,t2) := (i-1,j-1). On the Euclidean space, the obtained surface is
% C^2.
%
% function pb = control_points_simple_generation_2d(pb)
%    returns pb, the structure of the problem, updated with the control
% 	 points pb.controlPoints (in a 2d-cell).
%
%    The control points are obtained in a way that the mean squared 
%    acceleration of the surface is minimized on the Euclidean
%    space, and such that the surface can be computed in a C^2 manner.
%
% Input: pb, the structure of the interpolating problem, containing
% 			pb.dataPoints (2-cell with data points)
% 			pb.degree 	  (the degree of the curve: default 3)
%           pb.threshold  (the threshold on the weights of the final
% 	                       combination)
%           pb.patchM     (the number of patches in the first coordinate
%                           - rows, counted from top to bottom)
% 			pb.patchN     (the number of patches in the second coordinate
% 						    - columns, counted from left to right)
% 			pb.manifold	  (the manifold structure from Manopt)
%           
% Output: pb, the structure of the approximation problem, edited
%         with the field pb.controlPoints, the (deg+1)^2 control points 
%         of each patch, stored in a (M*deg+1, N*deg+1)-cell).
