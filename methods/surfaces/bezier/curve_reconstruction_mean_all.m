function pb = curve_reconstruction_mean_all(varargin)
% Reconstructs the Bezier curve based on a karcher mean.
%
% function pb = curve_reconstruction_mean_all(pb,X,Y)
%    Reconstrucs the Bezier curve based on the control points stored in
%    the structure pb, at times (t1,t2). The piecewize Bezier surface is
%    piecewise cubic.
%
% Input: pb, the structure of the interpolating problem, containing
% 		   pb.dataPoints    (2-cell with data points)
% 		   pb.degree        (the degree of the curve: default 3)
%        pb.controlPoints (the control points).
%        X, the meshgrid of times in the X direction (pxq).
%        Y, the meshdrid of times in the Y direction (pxq).
%           
% Output: pb, the structure of the approximation problem, edited
%         with the field pb.curve in which the data are stored in a
%         (p,q,m,n) matrix.
