% function Z = bezierSurfaceSplineReconstruction(X,Y,controlPoints,degree)
%    returns Z, the value of the Euclidean composite Bezier surface of 
%    degree DEGREE, driven by the control points CONTROLPOINTS and 
%    evaluated at (X,Y). The CONTROLPOINTS are stored in a (mcp*ncp)-cell
%    of matrices (m*n), where m*n is the size of the Euclidean space.
%    The values X,Y are matrices of same size [p*q]. The degree is a scalar.
%
% outputs: Z is a [p,q,m,n] matrix.
