%% DE_CASTELJAU_EUCLIDEAN
%       Computes the Bezier surface in euclidean space based on the Bezier points b,
%       evaluated at time (t1,t2) in [0,1]. The degree (d) of the Bezier
% 		surface is given in entry.
% 
% Input: b       : the control points (cell d+1 x d+1).
%        t1,t2   : the evaluated time on the square [0,1]x[0,1].
% 		 d 		 : the degree of the curve.
%
% Output: the Bezier curve, in a matrix [dim1 x dim2]
