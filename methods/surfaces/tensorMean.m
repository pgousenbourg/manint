function y = tensorMean(M,points,weights,varargin)
% returns the tensorized 2D-mean of points associated with weights.
% The mean is computed with diadic averaging.
%
% function Y = tensorMean(M,points)
%    returns Y, the mean of four points with equal weights.
%
% function Y = tensorMean(M,points,weights)
%    returns Y, the mean of four points associated with given weights.
%
% function Y = tensorMean(M,points,weights,'orientation',dim)
%    dim can be 1 or 2, and forces the diadic mean to be done
%    in the dim direction. Default: 2.
%
% inputs:  M is a manopt manifold-structure containing the exp and log
%            operators.
%          points is a 4-cell of [p,DIM] manifold-valued points in
%            M. Each p sequence of points is associated with weights.
%          weights is a [p,4]-matrix with 4 columns of weights 
%            associated to each point.
%
% outputs: y is diadic mean of the points wrt the weights, stored in
%          a [p,DIM]-matrix.

%   Jan. 06, 2020 (PYG) - Modification of the logic to stage better the
%                         with the rest of the project. Now weights are
