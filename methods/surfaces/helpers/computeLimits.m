function limits = computeLimits(i,domains,rootCoords)
% Computes the (X,Y) limits of the domain i.
%
% limits = computeLimits(I,DOMAINS,ROOTCOORDS)
%    computes the limits [ymin,xmin,xmax,ymax] of the domain i.
%
% Inputs:  I (scalar), the line of the domain that has to be refined.
%          DOMAINS, a [px5]-matrix of domains referring to the indexes
%           of ROOTCOORDS. The first line is the parenting.
%          ROOTCOORDS, a matrix with two columns with the (X,Y)-
%           positions of the grid coordinates.
% 
% Outputs: Limits are stored in a 4-vector ordered like limit
%            [south (ymin), east (xmin), west (xmax), north (ymax)].

% /!\ WITH THIS HELPER, ASSOCIATED WITH FINDROOT, I COULD SIMPLIFY
%     FINDDOMAIN (I think ^^)
