function k = rootPos(i,j)
% Returns the line-position of a matrix-position representation.
%
% function k = rootPos(i,j)
%   returns k, the position in a line-vector when this position is
%   given in (x,y)-coordinates, stored in a p-vector.
%
% function k = rootPos(i)
%   returns k, the matrix-position when the value is given as a
%   line-position i, stored in a [px2]-matrix.
%
% In other words, this helper is doing the bijection:
%         12  ---  22     <->     3  ---  4
%          |       |              |       |
%  y ^     |       |              |       |
%    |    11  ---  21             1  ---  2
%    --> x
