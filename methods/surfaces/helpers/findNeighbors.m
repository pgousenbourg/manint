function neighbors = findNeighbors(i,domains,rootCoords)
% Finds the four neighbors to domain i, at the same parenting level.
%
% neighbors = findNeighbors(I,DOMAINS,ROOTCOORDS)
%    finds the four neighbors [south,east,west,north] of domain i.
%    Returns 0 if no neighbor is found (for instance, if the domain i
%    is at the border of the meta-domain).
%
% Inputs:  I (scalar), the line of the domain that has to be refined.
%          DOMAINS, a [px5]-matrix of domains referring to the indexes
%           of ROOTCOORDS. The first line is the parenting.
%          ROOTCOORDS, a matrix with two columns with the (X,Y)-
%           positions of the grid coordinates.
% 
% Outputs: neighbors, is a 4-vector ordered like 
%            [south, east,west,north].
%          Returns 0 if no neighbor is found.
