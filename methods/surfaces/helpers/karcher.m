function y = karcher(M,x,b,w)
% Computes the Riemannian center of mass of the points b weighted by w.
%
% function y = karcher(M,x,b,w)
%    returns y, the Karcher mean given by
%            y = sum_i w_i dist(b_i,x),
%    where dist is the geodesic distance. b is a cell of the same
%    dimension of w.
