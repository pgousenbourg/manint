function [cost,route] = dijkstra(graph,in,out)
% Solves the shortest path problem given a graph (stored as an adjacency matrix)
% and in and out nodes (given as indexes).
%
% function [COST,ROUTE] = dijkstra(GRAPH)
%    Returns the min COST and the min-cost ROUTE between all vertices
%    of the graph GRAPH, using Dijkstra algorithm. GRAPH is given as an
%    adjacency matrix.
%
% function [COST,ROUTE] = dijkstra(GRAPH,IN,OUT)
%    Returns the min COST and the min-cost ROUTE between IN and OUT in
%    the given GRAPH, using Dijkstra algorithm. GRAPH is given as an
%    adjacency matrix.
%
% Inputs:  GRAPH, N by N adjacency matrix containing the cost of each
%            edge.
%          IN, OUT (optional), the indexes of the input and output
%            points of the graph. Scalar or vector of length, only.
%            By default, 1:N is given to IN and OUT.
%
% Outputs: COST, a LXM matrix containing the costs of each path for the
%            L inputs and M outputs.
%          ROUTE, a LXM cell containing the paths between the L inputs
%            and the M outputs.
