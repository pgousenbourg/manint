function b = bki(M,dataPoints, A, k, i, threshold)
% Computes the control point b_k^i.
%
% function b = bki(M, dataPoints, A, k, i, threshold)
%    returns b, a single control points based on A, in the segment i
%    and position k. The coefficients of A are cut at a given threshold 
%    around the diagonal.
%
% Input: M          (manifold structure of Manopt)
%        dataPoints (1-cell with data points)
%        A          (matrix defining the linear combinations of the
%                    dataPoints used for computing b_k^i)
%        i          (the segment)
%        k          (the position within the segment, between 0 and 3)
%        threshold  (the threshold applied in the lincomb).
