function graph = domain2adjacency(varargin)
% Transforms a domain to an adjacency matrix of a graph, where the
% cost of each edge is the distance between each connected roots.
%
% function graph = domain2adjacency(M,domains,rootPoints)
%    returns an adjacency matrix between each root of the domain. The
%    cost of each edge is given by the Riemannian distance between
%    the connected rootPoints.
%
% function graph = domain2adjacency(domains,rootCoords)
%    returns an adjacency matrix between each root of the domain. The
%    cost of each edge is given by the Euclidean distance between each
%    node in the domain.
%
% Inputs:  M, a manifold structure from Manopt.
%          DOMAINS, a [px5] matrix of domains (simplified or not) where
%            each line correspond to the four corners of a patch.
%          ROOTPOINTS, a cell with all the roots associated with the domain,
%            expressed on M. There may be n elements.
%          ROOTCOORDS, a matrix [nx2] containing the coordinates in the
%            domain.
%
% Outputs: graph, an adjacency matrix [n x n] with distance costs
%          between each edge.
