function b = simple_tensorization(M, dataPoints, A, threshold)
% Computes the control points of a C^2-Bezier spline in R^n.

% function b = simple_tensorization(M,dataPoints,A,threshold)
%    returns b, a cell containing data points of a C2 Bezier spline in
%    the Euclidean space. The manifold M is used to verify the distance
%    of the points wrt the geodesic. A is the matrix that generates the
%    control points. Threshold limits the input from the matric.
