function bool = isParent(i,domain)
% Checks if the ith line of domain is a parent of other domains.
%
% function isParent(DOMAIN,I)
%    Returns a logical number saying if the I^th line of DOMAIN has
%    associated childrens in DOMAIN.
%    If I is a vector, then the function will return a vector of
%    booleans checking every entry of I.
