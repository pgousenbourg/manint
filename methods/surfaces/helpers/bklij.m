function b = bklij(M, dataPoints, Am, An, k, l, i, j, threshold)
% Computes the control point b_kl^ij.
%
% function b = bklij(M, dataPoints, Am, An, k, l, i, j, threshold)
%    returns b, a single control points based on Am and An, in the patch
%    (i,j), and position (k,l) within the patch. The coefficients
%    of Am and An are cut at a given threshold around the diagonal.
%
% Input: M          (manifold structure of Manopt)
%        dataPoints (2-cell with data points)
%        Am, An     (matrices defining the linear combinations of the
%                    dataPoints used for computing b_kl^ij)
%        i,j        (the patch)
%        k,l        (the position within the patch, between 0 and 3)
%        threshold  (the threshold applied in the lincomb).
