function tangentValues = transportLifting(M,rootPoints,dataPoints,domains,rootCoords,dataCoords,coarse)
% Lifts the dataPoints in the tangent space of each rootPoint by
% by following the shortest path in the domain.
%
% function tangentValues = transportLifting(M,rootPoints,dataPoints,domains,rootCoords,dataCoords)
%    returns tangentValues, the representation in T_{rootPoints{i}}M 
%    of the dataPoints, lifted thanks to the M.log operator of M, a 
%    manifold manopt-structure.
%    The dataPoints are first lifted in the closest rootPoint, and then
%    and then the tangent values are transported via M.transp() from 
%    rootPoint to rootPoint, following a shortest path in the domain.
%
% inputs:  M, a manopt manifold-structure containing the M.log operator.
%          rootPoints, a vector-cell of P elements with the rootPoint on 
%            the manifold M.
%          dataPoints, a vector-cell of Q points to be lifted to the 
%            tangent space at rootPoints.
%          domains, the domain where the rootPoints are set.
%          rootCoords, the coordinates of the rootPoints.
%          dataCoords, the coordinates of the dataPoints.
%          coarse (optional) is a boolean that specifies if the points
%            must be approximated by a linear surface within a patch
%            (default: 0).
%            coarse and pointsCoords must be provided together.
%
% outputs: tangentValues, a [PxQ]-cell containing the lifted
%            version of the points to the tangent spaces at rootPoints.
