function y = karcherMean(M,points,weights)
% returns the 2D-weighted mean of points associated with weights.
% The mean is computed with a so-called Karcher mean.
%
% function Y = karcherMean(M,points)
%    returns Y, the mean of four points with equal weights.
%
% function Y = karcherMean(M,points,weights)
%    returns Y, the mean of four points associated with given weights.
%
% inputs:  M is a manopt manifold-structure containing the exp and log
%            operators.
%          points is a 4-cell of [p,DIM] manifold-valued points in
%            M. Each p sequence of points is associated with weights.
%          weights is a [p,4]-matrix with 4 columns of weights 
%            associated to each point.
%
% outputs: y is the karcher mean of the points wrt the weights, stored 
%          in a [p,DIM]-matrix.
